# SDSS-IV-eBOSS-Systematics

This repository contains all the systematics map made for eBOSS LRGs.
The script will use multivariate regression to build models for predicting LRG density to study the uniformity and homogeneity.
The predicted density maps are used for creating the mask of the survey.
